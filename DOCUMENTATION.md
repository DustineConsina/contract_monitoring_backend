---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Step 1: Create Environment File

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

### Step 2: Configure Database

Edit `.env` file and update database credentials:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=pfda_contract_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### Step 3: Configure Mail Settings

For email notifications, configure your mail settings in `.env`:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="PFDA Contract System"
```

### Step 4: Configure Application URL

APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Step 5: Configure Storage

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

This creates a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`.

Create a new MySQL database named `pfda_contract_db` (or your preferred name):

```sql
CREATE DATABASE pfda_contract_db CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
```

### Step 2: Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create all necessary tables:

- contracts
- payments
- chat_messages
- audit_logs
- notifications
- cache, jobs, sessions tables

### Step 3: Seed Initial Data

```bash

## ⏰ Scheduled Tasks

The system uses Laravel's task scheduler for automated operations. These commands run automatically:

### Daily Tasks

1. **Send Payment Reminders**
   ```bash
   php artisan payments:send-reminders
   ```
   - Sends reminders for payments due in the next 7 days
   - Sends overdue payment notifications (weekly)

2. **Send Contract Expiry Notifications**
   ```bash
   php artisan contracts:send-expiry-notifications
   ```
   - Notifies tenants of expiring contracts (30, 14, 7, 3, 1 day before)

3. **Calculate Overdue Interest**
   ```bash
   php artisan payments:calculate-overdue-interest
   ```
   - Applies interest to overdue payments based on contract rate

4. **Update Expired Contracts**
   ```bash
   php artisan contracts:update-expired
   ```
   - Automatically marks contracts as expired after end date

### Setting Up Cron (Linux/Production)

Add to crontab:
```bash
* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Windows Task Scheduler (Development)

For XAMPP on Windows, you can manually run:
```bash
php artisan schedule:work
```

Or set up Windows Task Scheduler to run the scheduler every minute.
